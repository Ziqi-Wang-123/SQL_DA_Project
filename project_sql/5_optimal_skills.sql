/* 
selecting sd.skills in the SELECT clause 
but not including it in the GROUP BY clause

why it works here:
In postgresql,If all non-aggregated columns functionally depend on the GROUP BY columns, 
the query is allowed. 

sd.skills (skill name) functionally depends on skill_id
There is only one skill name per skill ID.
